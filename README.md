Angular web application for tracking your workout-progress. <br/>
The website has a connection to a Firebase backend with an implemented user registration and authentication functionality. <br/>
Exercises are stored in a key-value database: Firestore. <br/>
Frontend is responsive and dynamically changes dependent on the screen size: achieved with Angular Material library. <br/>
Practice of using observables, NgRx for state management and splitting up the application into modules for better maintainability.
